# Quickstarts
This folder is dedicated to all the quickstarts I have been doing on JBOSS Red Hat Studio.  I wanted to figure out the basics of GitHub since it had been awhile. Also I will have a place I can show off my work. None of the projects within this folder will be job related besides the fact that I am researching different kinds of code. Please feel free to take any code that may help you unless you are being graded for your own work. If this is the Case copy and pasting would not be beneficial.
